We are happy to announce our own **github.io website/blog**.

What is AgentIdea? We design software systems and promote modular and elegant code in order to create event driven real time systems. 
We started by creating early versions of Single Page Applications in browsers in 1998 and added working with Tibco in 2000, realizing the power of Enterprise Integration Patterns and Message Oriented Middleware. We wrote a trading system for Jefferies which processes 5% of daily NYSE volume.

We will use this blog to write about our methodology, patterns and frameworks we have developed over the years, as well as small productivity tips.

*** The AgentIdea Principles***: a subjective list of elements that make up a successfull IT culture that we and just about anyone else would want to participate in.
    Freedom of speech
    Freedom of opinion
    Transparency
    Good quality of life
    Elegance of expression
    Joy

We are happy to announce our own **github.io website/blog**.

What is AgentIdea, a lot of people ask me.  Essentially we design software systems and promote modular and elegant code in order to create event driven real time systems.  We started by working with Tibco back in the year 2000 and realized the power of Enterprise Integration Patterns and Message Oriented Middleware (MOM).  We wrote a trading system for Jefferies and to this day it still runs processing a significant portion of the daily NYSE volume ( 5% )

``` We will use this blog to write about our methodology, patterns and frameworks we have developed over the years ```

*** The AgentIdea Prime Objective ***
These are principal elements that make up a successfull IT culture that we and just about anyone else would want to participate in.
